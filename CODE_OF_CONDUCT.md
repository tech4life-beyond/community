## 1. Purpose

This Code of Conduct defines the behavioral and ethical standards required for participation in Tech4Life.

Tech4Life is not only a technology ecosystem — it is a responsibility ecosystem.

All participants must align with the principles outlined in this document.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Respect for All Life

Technology developed within Tech4Life must not intentionally harm:
- Humans
- Animals
- Ecosystems
- Future generations

Disrespect toward individuals or communities is incompatible with participation.

---

### 2.2 Horizontal Leadership

Tech4Life operates under a horizontal model:

- No authoritarian behavior
- No ego-based dominance
- Authority emerges from contribution, not position
- Decisions prioritize collective reasoning

Architects guide. They do not command.

---

### 2.3 Intellectual Integrity

Participants must:
- Credit original contributors
- Avoid plagiarism
- Document decisions transparently
- Respect TOIL attribution standards

Misrepresentation of authorship is grounds for removal.

---

### 2.4 Ethical Innovation

All projects must pass ethical review prior to advancement.

Prohibited categories include:
- Surveillance without consent
- Manipulative or addictive systems
- Environmentally destructive designs
- Weaponization of technology

If a product creates systemic harm, it will not proceed.

---

### 2.5 Professional Communication

Participants must:
- Communicate respectfully
- Avoid harassment or discrimination
- Resolve conflicts constructively
- Separate critique of ideas from critique of people

Disagreements are welcome. Disrespect is not.

---

## 3. Confidentiality & Transparency Balance

Participants must:
- Respect NDA boundaries when applicable
- Avoid leaking sensitive commercial information
- Maintain transparency within approved governance channels

Tech4Life values openness, but not recklessness.

---

## 4. Conflict Resolution

When conflict arises:

1. Direct dialogue between parties
2. Mediation within the Product Cell
3. Escalation to Architect review
4. Governance review if required

Escalation is a tool of clarity, not punishment.

---

## 5. Enforcement

Violations may result in:
- Warning
- Suspension of access
- Removal from project cell
- Permanent exclusion from ecosystem

All enforcement decisions must be documented.

---

## 6. Commitment Statement
