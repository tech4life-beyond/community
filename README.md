# Tech4Life & Beyond — Community Hub

**Tech for Life, Tech for All™**

Welcome to the Tech4Life & Beyond open ecosystem.
This repository is the **entry point** for contributors, creators, and collaborators.

## What Tech4Life & Beyond Is
Tech4Life & Beyond LLC (Miami, Florida, USA) builds **ethical, life-enhancing intellectual property**:
- innovative physical products
- interoperability systems (e.g., KIVAI)
- documentation and standards that enable safe collaboration

## What This Organization Is Not
- Not a typical startup with employees.
- Not a centralized “company-owned” IP factory.
- Not a marketplace for harmful technology.

## Core Model (Simple)
**Creators own their work** under TOIL governance.
When a product is licensed commercially, **royalties are shared** with contributors according to the internal finance model and contribution records.

## The Repositories (Map)
### Public (Core Ecosystem)
- `toil` — The Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL)
- `tlos` — Tech4Life Living Operating Standards
- `kivai` — Intent Standard + gateway runtime (infrastructure)
- `product-creation-pipeline` — Pack validation rules and tooling
- `product-registry` — Canonical product registry exports
- `products` — Product Packs (public, redacted where necessary)
- `community` — This hub (how to contribute and operate)

### Private (Internal Operations)
- `finance-private` — Internal finance, royalty operations, confidential models
- `legal-private` — Internal legal drafts, templates, confidential operations
- `armanu-curriculum` — Internal training curriculum and culture (Armanu)

## Start Here (Contributor Onboarding)
1) Read **TOIL**: go to `toil`
2) Read the operating standards: go to `tlos`
3) Learn how Product Packs work: go to `product-creation-pipeline`
4) Explore products: go to `products`
5) Pick a path:
   - Build a new Product Pack (recommended)
   - Improve docs, tools, validation rules
   - Build adapters and gateway functionality in KIVAI

## The Product Pack Lifecycle (Operational Flow)
1) Idea → define problem + ethical constraints
2) Create a Product Pack in `products/` following the required structure
3) Validate pack with the pipeline
4) Register and publish (public, redacted if needed)
5) Prototype and iterate
6) Licensing outreach (website + private showroom)
7) Royalty agreement under TOIL (commercial)
8) Monthly reporting + royalty distribution (internal ops)

## Contribution Rules (Non-Negotiable)
- Documentation and repo content must be **English**.
- No harmful tech: if it can be used to harm, it must be redesigned or restricted.
- No confidential finance/legal data in public repos.
