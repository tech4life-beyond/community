# Tech4Life & Beyond — Community

This repository defines how individuals can engage, contribute, and grow within the Tech4Life ecosystem.

Tech4Life & Beyond operates under a structured, governance-first model defined by TLOS (Tech4Life Operating System).

This is not an informal open-source playground.
This is a disciplined innovation ecosystem.

## Purpose of This Repository

The `community` repository serves as:

- A public onboarding entry point
- A contributor progression reference
- A participation and role definition guide
- A behavioral and ethical alignment reference

All contributors must understand and align with TLOS before participating in product development.

TLOS is the canonical source of:
- Architectural decisions

If any document in this repository conflicts with TLOS, TLOS prevails.
