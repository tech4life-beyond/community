Welcome to Tech4Life & Beyond.

This guide shows exactly how to begin contributing safely and correctly.

---

## Step 1 — Start from the Hub

Your official entry point is:

- https://tech4life-beyond.github.io/community/

From the hub you can access all core repositories and onboarding docs.

---

## Step 2 — Understand the Foundation

Before contributing, understand the core principles:

- Technology must serve life
- Ethical alignment is mandatory
- Documentation ensures traceability
- Contribution must be transparent

Tech4Life is a responsibility ecosystem.

---

## Step 3 — Choose Your Role

You may begin as:

This is the recommended entry point.

---

### Creator

---

## Step 4 — Learn the Product Pack System

All Tech4Life products exist as Product Packs inside the **products** repository:

- https://github.com/tech4life-beyond/products

Product Pack structure:

```
products/
  product-name/
    README.md
    01-toil-registration/
    02-technical-summary/
    03-ethics-statement/
    04-licensing-readiness/
```

Product Packs make products traceable and licensable.

## Step 5 — Contribute Through Pull Requests

Standard workflow:

1. Create a branch
2. Make changes
3. Commit with clear messages
4. Open a Pull Request
5. Ensure validation passes
6. Merge when approved

---

## Step 6 — Start with a Safe First Contribution

Recommended first contributions:

- fix typos or broken links in documentation
- improve clarity in a Product Pack README
- add missing documentation in optional folders

If you want to create a new product, read:

- [How Products Work](how-products-work.md)

## Step 7 — Ethics First

Mandatory rule:

If a product creates harm, it must not be created.

Ethics overrides speed.
