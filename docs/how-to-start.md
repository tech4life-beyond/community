# How to Start — Tech4Life Contributor Quickstart

Welcome to Tech4Life & Beyond.

This guide explains exactly how to begin contributing safely and correctly inside the Tech4Life ecosystem.

---

## Step 1 — Understand the Foundation

Before contributing, you must understand the core principles:

- Technology must serve life
- Ethical alignment is mandatory
- Documentation ensures traceability
- Contribution must be transparent

Tech4Life is a responsibility ecosystem.

---

## Step 2 — Choose Your Role

You may begin as:

### Contributor

Supports:

- documentation
- testing
- improvements
- validation

This is the recommended entry point.

---

### Creator

Creates new products or evolves existing ones.

Creators build Product Packs and prototypes.

---

### Architect

Maintains structural clarity and system integrity.

Architects protect long-term stability.

---

## Step 3 — Learn the Product Pack System

All Tech4Life products exist as Product Packs inside the products repository.

Example structure:

```
products/
  product-name/
    README.md
    01-toil-registration/
    02-technical-summary/
    03-ethics-statement/
    04-licensing-readiness/
```

Product Packs make products traceable and licensable.

---

## Step 4 — Contribute Through GitHub

Standard workflow:

1. Fork or branch the repository
2. Make changes
3. Commit with clear messages
4. Open a Pull Request
5. Ensure validation passes
6. Merge when approved

This preserves system integrity.

---

## Step 5 — Build or Improve a Product Pack

You may:

- improve an existing Product Pack
- create a new Product Pack
- improve documentation
- contribute to prototypes

All Product Packs must pass pipeline validation.

---

## Step 6 — Prototype and Validate

If creating a product:

- build a prototype
- test safely
- document results

Prototype evidence is stored in:

```
07-prototype-status/
```

---

## Step 7 — Maintain Ethical Alignment

Mandatory rule:

If a product creates harm, it must not be created.

Ethics overrides speed.

Ethics protects the ecosystem.

---

## Step 8 — Continue Learning

Next recommended topics:

- Product Pack Method
- Licensing readiness
- Product Cell operations
- KIVAI platform integration (optional)

These topics enable full participation.

---

## Status

You are now ready to begin contributing.

Creation begins with responsibility.
