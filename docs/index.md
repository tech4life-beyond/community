# Tech4Life & Beyond — Creator Onboarding Portal

**Official onboarding portal for creators, engineers, architects, and contributors.**

Tech4Life & Beyond is a structured ecosystem for creating ethical, licensable technologies that serve life.

This portal explains:

- what Tech4Life is
- how products are created
- how licensing works
- how you can participate

---

# Mission

Tech4Life exists to create technologies that:

- serve humanity
- respect life
- protect the planet
- enable responsible innovation

Technology must serve life — not exploit it.

---

# How Tech4Life Works

Tech4Life operates through a structured creation pipeline:

```
Idea
 ↓
Product Pack
 ↓
Validation Pipeline
 ↓
Product Registry
 ↓
Prototype
 ↓
Licensing Readiness
 ↓
Licensing Agreement
 ↓
Product reaches the world
```

Each step ensures ethical alignment, technical clarity, and licensing readiness.

# Core Components

## Product Packs

Product Packs are structured documentation bundles that define a product.

They ensure:

- traceable authorship
- ethical accountability
- licensing readiness

Location:

```
products/
```

---

## Product Creation Pipeline

The pipeline validates Product Packs automatically.

This ensures structural integrity and prevents incomplete products from entering the registry.

---

## Product Registry

The registry provides a canonical index of all products.

It preserves creation history and licensing traceability.

---

## TOIL — Tech4Life Open Impact License

TOIL governs how products are shared and licensed.

Principles:

- Ethical use is open
- Commercial use requires licensing
- Creators are recognized
- Contribution history is preserved
