## Welcome

Tech4Life & Beyond is a structured ecosystem for creating ethical, licensable technologies that serve life.

This portal is the **central entry point** to understand:

- what Tech4Life is
- how products are created and validated
- how licensing works under TOIL
- where each repository lives
- how to join and contribute

---

## Mission

Tech4Life exists to create technologies that:

- serve humanity
- respect life
- protect the planet
- enable responsible innovation

Technology must serve life — not exploit it.

---

## Product IP Safety (Patents & Prior Art)

**Important:** Tech4Life products must be legally safe to license.

Before investing significant work, each Product Cell must perform an **IP / patent check**:

- search for existing patents and protected IP for the same concept
- document findings in the Product Pack
- if the core concept is already patented by a third party, the product **cannot be licensed under TOIL** unless rights/permission are obtained

Architect review is required before a product is marked licensing-ready.

## How Tech4Life Works

Tech4Life operates through a structured creation lifecycle:

```
Idea
 ↓
Product Pack
 ↓
Validation Pipeline
 ↓
Product Registry
 ↓
Prototype
 ↓
Licensing Readiness
 ↓
Licensing Agreement
 ↓
Product reaches the world
```

Each step ensures ethical alignment, technical clarity, and licensing readiness.
