# How TOIL Works — Tech4Life Open Impact License Overview

This document explains the purpose and operational model of the Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL).

TOIL governs how Tech4Life products are shared, used, and licensed.

It protects creators while ensuring technology serves life.

# Purpose of TOIL

TOIL exists to balance:

- open ethical access
- creator protection
- responsible commercialization

TOIL ensures that technology remains aligned with life-serving principles.

# Core Principles

## Ethical Use is Open

Anyone may study, learn from, and ethically use Tech4Life product designs.

Knowledge should remain accessible.

## Commercial Distribution Requires Licensing

Commercial manufacturing, distribution, or retail requires a licensing agreement.

This ensures:

- creator protection
- ethical oversight
- product integrity

Licensing enables responsible scaling.

---

## Creator Attribution is Permanent

TOIL preserves creator attribution.

Authorship history is documented through:

# How Licensing Works

When a company wants to manufacture or distribute a Tech4Life product:

1. They request licensing
2. Tech4Life reviews alignment
3. A licensing agreement is established
4. The partner manufactures and distributes the product

This ensures responsible deployment.

# Why TOIL Exists

Traditional systems often separate creators from their creations.

TOIL preserves the connection between creators and their work.

It ensures:

- attribution integrity
- ethical continuity
- responsible scaling

# Relationship to GitHub

GitHub provides:

- timestamped authorship record
- transparent contribution history
- verifiable creation traceability

This strengthens TOIL protection.
