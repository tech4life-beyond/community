This page explains the purpose and operational model of the Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL).

TOIL governs how Tech4Life products are shared, used, and licensed.

It protects creators while ensuring technology serves life.

---

## Where TOIL Lives

The canonical TOIL license repository:

- [github.com/tech4life-beyond/toil](https://github.com/tech4life-beyond/toil)

---

## Purpose of TOIL

TOIL exists to balance:

- open ethical access
- creator protection
- responsible commercialization

---

## Core Principles

### 1) Ethical Use is Open

Anyone may study, learn from, and ethically use Tech4Life product designs.

Knowledge should remain accessible.

---

### 2) Commercial Distribution Requires Licensing

Commercial manufacturing, distribution, or retail requires a licensing agreement.

This enables:

- creator protection
- ethical oversight
- product integrity

---

### 3) Creator Attribution is Permanent

TOIL preserves attribution through:

- Product Packs (products repo)  
  [github.com/tech4life-beyond/products](https://github.com/tech4life-beyond/products)

- Product Registry (canonical index)  
  [github.com/tech4life-beyond/product-registry](https://github.com/tech4life-beyond/product-registry)

- Git history (timestamped authorship)

Authorship cannot be erased.

---

### 4) Ethical Restrictions Apply

Products must not be used to create harm.

Prohibited categories include:

- weaponization
- surveillance without consent
- environmental harm
- systems designed for exploitation

---

## IP / Patents (Important)

TOIL licensing requires that a product is legally safe to license.

If a core concept is already patented by a third party, it **cannot be licensed under TOIL** unless rights/permission are obtained.

Product Cells must document an IP/patent check before licensing readiness.

---

## How Licensing Works (High Level)

When a company wants to manufacture or distribute a Tech4Life product:

1. Licensing inquiry is submitted
2. Tech4Life reviews alignment and fit
3. A licensing agreement is established
4. The partner manufactures and distributes the product

Exact financial terms are defined in private licensing agreements.

---

## Relationship to GitHub

GitHub provides:

- timestamped authorship record
- transparent contribution history
- verifiable traceability

This strengthens long-term trust.

---

## Summary

TOIL ensures that:

- knowledge remains open
- creators remain protected
- licensing remains ethical
- products serve life
