# How Products Work — Tech4Life Product Lifecycle

This document explains how products are created, validated, and licensed inside the Tech4Life ecosystem.

Tech4Life transforms ideas into licensable, ethical, real-world technologies.

---

# Overview

Every Tech4Life product follows this lifecycle:

```
Idea
 ↓
Product Pack
 ↓
Validation Pipeline
 ↓
Product Registry
 ↓
Prototype
 ↓
Licensing Readiness
 ↓
Licensing Agreement
 ↓
Product reaches the world
```

Each step ensures safety, traceability, and licensing viability.

# Step 1 — Idea

Every product begins with a problem worth solving.

The idea must:

- serve life
- avoid harm
- justify its existence

Ideas alone do not create products.

Documentation creates products.

---

# Step 2 — Product Pack

The Product Pack is the official documentation bundle stored in the products repository.

Example structure:

```
products/
  product-name/
    README.md
    01-toil-registration/
    02-technical-summary/
    03-ethics-statement/
    04-licensing-readiness/
```

This structure ensures ethical and technical clarity.

---

# Step 3 — Validation Pipeline

The product-creation-pipeline automatically validates Product Packs.

It checks:

- required folders exist
- required files exist
- structural integrity

Invalid Product Packs cannot enter the system.

This protects system quality.

---

# Step 4 — Product Registry

Valid Product Packs are recorded in the product-registry.

The registry provides:

- canonical product index
- traceable authorship
- historical record

The registry creates permanent attribution.

---

# Step 5 — Prototype

A prototype validates real-world feasibility.

Prototypes may use platforms such as:

- Raspberry Pi
- ESP32
- embedded systems
- software systems

Prototype evidence is documented in the Product Pack.

---

# Step 6 — Licensing Readiness

A product becomes licensable when it has:

- working prototype
- clear documentation
- ethical evaluation
- defined partner alignment

Licensing readiness creates trust.

---

# Step 7 — Licensing Agreement

Tech4Life licenses products to:

- manufacturers
- distributors
- retailers

Licensing agreements define:

- rights
- responsibilities
- royalty structure

This enables real-world deployment.

---

# Step 8 — Product Deployment

The licensed partner manufactures and distributes the product.

The product reaches the world.

The creator's work becomes reality.

---

# Creator Role in Lifecycle

Creators:

- build Product Packs
- build prototypes
- maintain documentation
- evolve products

Creation is documented stewardship.

---

# Ethical Gate

At any point, if harm risk is discovered, the product must be paused and redesigned.

Ethics overrides progression.

---

# System Integrity

This lifecycle ensures:

- ethical alignment
- traceable authorship
- licensing readiness
- long-term ecosystem stability

---

# Status

This lifecycle is active.

Tech4Life is operational.

Products can now move from idea to reality.
