## Lifecycle Overview

Every Tech4Life product follows this lifecycle:

```
Idea
 ↓
Product Pack
 ↓
Validation Pipeline
 ↓
Product Registry
 ↓
Prototype
 ↓
Licensing Readiness
 ↓
Licensing Agreement
 ↓
Product reaches the world
```

Each step ensures safety, traceability, and licensing viability.

---

## Step 1 — Idea

Every product begins with a problem worth solving.

The idea must:

- serve life
- avoid harm
- justify its existence

---

## Step 2 — Product Pack (products repo)

The Product Pack is the official documentation bundle stored in:

- https://github.com/tech4life-beyond/products

It provides:

- traceable authorship
- technical explanation
- ethical evaluation
- licensing readiness

---

## Step 3 — Validation Pipeline

The Product Pack must pass automated validation from:

- https://github.com/tech4life-beyond/product-creation-pipeline

The pipeline prevents incomplete packs from entering the ecosystem.

---

## Step 4 — Product Registry

Valid Product Packs are recorded in:

- https://github.com/tech4life-beyond/product-registry

The registry provides:

- canonical product index
- traceable authorship
- historical record

---

## Step 5 — Prototype

A prototype validates real-world feasibility.

Prototype evidence belongs in the Product Pack under:

```
07-prototype-status/
```

---

## Step 6 — Licensing Readiness

A product becomes licensable when it has:

- working prototype
- clear documentation
- ethical evaluation and mitigations
- defined partner alignment (manufacturer / distributor / retailer)

---

## Step 7 — Licensing Agreement

Tech4Life licenses products under TOIL governance.

Licensing is governed by:

- https://github.com/tech4life-beyond/toil

---

## Step 8 — Deployment

The licensed partner manufactures and distributes the product.

The product reaches the world.

---

## Ethical Gate

At any point, if harm risk is discovered, the product must be paused and redesigned.

Ethics overrides progression.
