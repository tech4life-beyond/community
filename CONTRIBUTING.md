# Contributing & Collaboration Framework

**Tech4Life & Beyond LLC**  
**Applies to:** All Product Cells and collaborative initiatives

---

## 1. Purpose

This document defines how collaboration operates inside Tech4Life.
Contributions are governed by Tech4Life Open Impact License (TOIL) v1.0.

It establishes:
- Operational clarity
- Accountability standards
- Decision-making structure
- Documentation discipline

Collaboration without structure leads to chaos. Structure without ethics leads to rigidity. Tech4Life balances both.

---

## 2. Product Cell Structure

Each product is developed by a **Product Cell**.

A Product Cell may include:
- 1 Architect (facilitator, not commander)
- 1–3 Creators
- Contributors (as needed)
- Ethics reviewer (assigned or rotating)

Cells remain small by design (recommended: 3–7 members).

---

## 3. Decision-Making Model

Tech4Life follows a **Consensus-Oriented Model**:

1. Proposal drafted
2. Open feedback period
3. Ethical review check
4. Agreement threshold reached
5. Decision documented

If consensus cannot be reached:
- Architect facilitates structured decision round
- Governance layer may intervene if required

No unilateral authority overrides documented process.

---

## 4. Documentation Requirements

All Product Cells must:
- Use official templates
- Log major decisions
- Document design iterations
- Maintain version control

If it is not documented, it does not exist.

---

## 5. Contribution Tracking

Each contributor’s work must be:
- Transparent
- Time-stamped
- Linked to deliverables

Contribution weight affects future royalty allocation.

---

## 6. Ethical Checkpoints

Every major milestone must pass:
- Ethical alignment review
- Non-harm evaluation
- Sustainability consideration

A project may be paused if ethical concerns arise.

---

## 7. Conflict Prevention

Product Cells must:
- Clarify expectations early
- Define roles clearly
- Avoid overlapping authority
- Separate idea critique from personal critique

Preventing conflict is superior to resolving conflict.

---

## 8. Exit Protocol

A contributor may:
- Exit voluntarily with notice
- Remain credited for documented work

Departing members cannot remove prior contributions from the project.

---

## 9. Integrity Clause

Collaboration is a privilege.

Repeated disregard for process, ethics, or documentation may result in removal from the Cell.
