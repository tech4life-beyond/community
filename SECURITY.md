# Security Policy

## Reporting
If you discover:
- a vulnerability
- a workflow supply-chain risk
- accidental disclosure of confidential information

Do not post exploit details publicly.
Contact the organization Owners/Architects via the internal security reporting channel.

## Supply-Chain Controls
- GitHub Actions must be pinned by commit SHA.
- CI dependencies should be version-pinned where practical.
