# Conflict Resolution Framework

**Tech4Life & Beyond LLC**  
**Applies to:** All participants within the Tech4Life ecosystem

---

## 1. Purpose

Conflict is natural in collaborative innovation.

This framework ensures conflicts are resolved:
- Transparently
- Ethically
- Without ego dominance
- Without vertical authority abuse

Conflict is treated as a signal for structural clarification, not personal attack.

---

## 2. Types of Conflict

Conflicts may arise from:

- Technical disagreements
- Credit allocation disputes
- Ethical concerns
- Documentation discrepancies
- Communication breakdowns

Each type requires proportional response.

---

## 3. Resolution Escalation Path

### Level 1 — Direct Dialogue

Parties must attempt resolution directly through:
- Calm discussion
- Documented clarification
- Focus on problem, not personality

Most conflicts should end here.

---

### Level 2 — Product Cell Mediation

If unresolved:

- Architect facilitates structured dialogue
- Contribution logs are reviewed
- Ethical alignment is reassessed

The goal is restoration, not punishment.

---

### Level 3 — Governance Review

If mediation fails:

- Issue escalates to Governance layer
- Independent review conducted
- Written decision issued

Decision must be documented and justified.

---

## 4. Ethical Overrides

If conflict involves potential harm to:
- Humans
- Ecosystems
- Legal compliance

The project may be paused immediately pending review.

Safety overrides momentum.

---

## 5. Credit Disputes

In disputes regarding contribution weighting:

- Documentation is primary evidence
- Undocumented work carries no weight
- Retroactive credit claims require consensus approval

Transparency prevents manipulation.

---

## 6. Behavioral Violations

If conflict stems from misconduct:

Possible outcomes include:
- Warning
- Temporary suspension
- Removal from Product Cell
- Ecosystem exclusion

All enforcement must be documented.

---

## 7. Restoration Principle

Whenever possible, Tech4Life prioritizes:
- Education over punishment
- Clarification over blame
- Reintegration over exclusion

Permanent exclusion is last resort.

---

## 8. Finality Clause

Governance decisions are binding within the ecosystem.

Appeals may be requested only if new evidence emerges.
